# Complex Coordinates (C++)

# 📌 Overview
Complex Coordinates is a C++ console application that performs mathematical operations on complex numbers. The project demonstrates object-oriented programming, dynamic memory allocation, and modular code design using header and source files.

# ✨ Features

Create and manipulate complex numbers
Perform operations:
Addition
Subtraction
Multiplication
Calculate:
Conjugate
Magnitude
Menu-driven user interaction
Dynamic memory usage for efficient computation

# 🛠️ Technologies & Concepts
Language: C++
Concepts Used:
Object-Oriented Programming (Classes & Objects)
Dynamic Memory Allocation
Pointers
Mathematical Computation
Modular Programming

📂 Project Structure
├── ComplexNumber.h    // Class definition
├── ComplexNumber.cpp  // Implementation of operations
├── Main.cpp           // Main program and menu logic

▶️ How to Run
Compile all files together:
g++ Main.cpp ComplexNumber.cpp -o ComplexCoordinates
Run the program:
./ComplexCoordinates
Follow the on-screen menu to perform operations.
📈 Learning Outcomes
Strengthened understanding of C++ memory management
Applied OOP principles to real-world mathematical problems
Improved modular and maintainable code structure

🚀 Future Improvements
Add support for multiple stored complex numbers
Improve input validation and error handling
Add unit tests
Create a graphical user interface (GUI)
