Complex Coordinates – C++ Project
📌 Overview
Complex Coordinates is a C++ console-based application that allows users to perform various mathematical operations on complex numbers. The project demonstrates strong fundamentals in object-oriented programming, dynamic memory allocation, and mathematical computation.
This project was developed as part of academic coursework to strengthen understanding of C++ classes, pointers, and modular program design.
✨ Features
Create and store complex numbers
Perform arithmetic operations:
➕ Addition
➖ Subtraction
✖️ Multiplication
Calculate:
Conjugate of a complex number
Magnitude (absolute value)
Menu-driven user interaction
Dynamic memory allocation for efficient data handling
🛠️ Technologies Used
Language: C++
Concepts:
Object-Oriented Programming (Classes & Objects)
Dynamic Memory Allocation
Pointers
Mathematical Computations
Modular Design (Header & Source Files)
📂 Project Structure
├── ComplexNumber.h    // Class definition for complex numbers
├── ComplexNumber.cpp  // Implementation of complex number operations
├── Main.cpp           // Main driver file with menu-based interaction
▶️ How It Works
The user is prompted to enter complex numbers.
A menu allows selection of operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, conjugate, or magnitude.
The program performs the selected operation and displays the result.
The process continues until the user chooses to exit.
